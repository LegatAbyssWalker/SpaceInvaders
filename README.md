# SpaceInvaders
A recreation of _Space Invaders_ in C++/SFML. 
Consisting of Aliens, UFO's, Player, Sounds, States, and more! Enjoy!
P.S., this is not a good version of the actual game and there are many bugs, but this is at least a good start!


# Dependancies
* SFML Version **2.5.0** or **higher**!
* **C++17** with a supporting compiler!

# New Information
* Removed Player code from `PlayingState.cpp` and implimented it into the Player class. 
* Added the ability for the user to go back to the Main Menu without having to win or lose, just press 'R'. 

# Current Ideas
* Creating Animation class.
* Implimenting Animation to Invaders.

# Bug Fixes
* Fixed Invader, Player, and UFO movements.
* Fixed Sound and Music functionality.
* Fixed Minor Bugs
